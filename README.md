I use my Chrome browser use a "temporary" reading list for blogs/articles/tutorials that I want to get to later. I let the tabs stay open.... forever.

This extension should will me a list of all the tabs that are open across my devices (_mostly_ mobile device) and shows a list so that I can read them on a laptop/bigger screen.
